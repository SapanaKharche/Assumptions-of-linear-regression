# Assumptions-of-linear-regression
I'm excited to share an update on my project focused on linear regression assumptions. In this project, I aim to explore and analyze the fundamental assumptions underlying linear regression models 
1. Linearity, 
2. No or low Autocorrelation, 
3. Normality, 
4. Homoscedasticity, 
5. Multicollinearity
